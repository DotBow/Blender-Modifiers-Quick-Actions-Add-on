# Blender Modifiers Quick Actions Add-on â”‚ [Latest Release](https://github.com/DotBow/Blender-Modifiers-Quick-Actions-Add-on/releases/latest)

Perform actions on modifiers under cursor (Apply - `Ctrl+A`, Duplicate - `Shift+D`, Delete - `X`).

<p align="justify">
In Blender 2.92-2.93 new concept of active modifier was introduced due to geometry nodes project. Since then it is only possible to use Apply, Duplicate, Delete actions on active modifier while in 2.91 it was possible by simply hovering on the one user needed. Modifiers Quick Actions add-on brings back behaviour from 2.91 without breaking the active modifier concept.
